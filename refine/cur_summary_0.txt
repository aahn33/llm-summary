The funeral of Jay Gatsby takes place in the rain with only a few attendees, including the owl-eyed man from Gatsby's library. Mr. Gatz, Gatsby's father, is hesitant to take Gatsby's body West for burial, as Gatsby had always preferred the East. Mr. Gatz believes that Gatsby had a promising future and compares him to successful businessman James J. Hill. Klipspringer, a friend of Gatsby's, calls and expresses relief that the funeral will not be publicized. Carraway visits Meyer Wolfshiem, who refuses to attend the funeral. Mr. Gatz shows Carraway a picture of Gatsby's house and discusses Gatsby's generosity. He also shares a book from Gatsby's childhood that outlines his daily schedule and ambitions. The owl-eyed man expresses surprise at the lack of attendees and comments on Gatsby's declining popularity.
