The narrator reflects on his father's advice about not criticizing others and being open to hearing their confidences. He admits to having tolerance but also acknowledges that it has its limits. The narrator then introduces himself as a member of a prominent family in the Middle West and describes his decision to move to the East to learn the bond business. He rented a house on an island near New York with a view of the water and the extravagant mansion of a man named Gatsby. The narrator recounts his visit to his second cousin once removed, Daisy, and her husband Tom Buchanan in their elaborate mansion in East Egg. He describes Tom's physical appearance and personality, as well as the presence of two young women in the room. Daisy greets the narrator with enthusiasm, and he mentions that one of the girls is named Baker. Daisy shares with Nick her feelings about her newborn daughter, expressing a desire for her to be a "beautiful little fool" in a world that she believes is terrible. However, Nick senses the insincerity in Daisy's words and feels that she is putting on a show for him. Later, Nick visits Tom and Daisy's house and meets Jordan Baker, a friend of Daisy's. Daisy and Tom discuss Jordan and Daisy suggests that Nick and Jordan spend time together. As Nick leaves, Daisy questions him about rumors of his engagement, which he denies. Nick then drives home and sees a figure, possibly Gatsby, standing near the water. The passage then shifts to a description of the "valley of ashes," a desolate area near the train tracks where Tom's mistress, Myrtle, lives. Tom takes Nick to meet Myrtle at a garage owned by her husband, George Wilson. Myrtle and Tom make plans to meet in New York, and Nick waits for her down the road. In this passage from F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," Tom Buchanan and his mistress, Myrtle Wilson, go to New York City together. Myrtle lies to her husband, George, telling him she is visiting her sister. In New York, Myrtle changes into a new dress and buys some items at a drugstore. She then expresses a desire to buy a dog, and they stop to look at puppies being sold by a man on the street. Tom corrects Myrtle when she mistakes one of the puppies for a police dog. They eventually arrive at Myrtle's small apartment, where they are joined by Myrtle's sister, Catherine, and her husband, Mr. McKee. The group drinks and socializes, with Myrtle and Catherine discussing their dissatisfaction with their marriages. Myrtle reveals that she and Tom plan to get married and move out West. Catherine also lies about her recent trip to Europe. The text describes a conversation between Mrs. McKee, Myrtle Wilson, and Catherine at a party. Mrs. McKee talks about almost marrying someone she considered beneath her, while Myrtle reveals that she married her husband because she thought he was a gentleman. Myrtle then tells the story of how she first met Tom Buchanan. The scene then shifts to a chaotic party at Gatsby's house, where guests come and go without being formally invited. The narrator, who was actually invited, feels out of place and tries to find his host. He eventually meets Jordan Baker and attaches himself to her. In this passage, the narrator, Nick Carraway, attends one of Gatsby's extravagant parties with his friend Jordan Baker. They mingle with the other guests, including two girls in yellow and three men referred to as Mr. Mumble. The conversation turns to rumors about Gatsby, with one of the girls suggesting that he may have killed a man or been a German spy during the war. The group becomes intrigued by Gatsby and begins searching for him. They eventually find him in a library, where he shows off his collection of real books. Gatsby then reveals himself as the host of the party and excuses himself to take a phone call. Nick is surprised by Gatsby's appearance, as he expected him to be older and less refined. Jordan and Nick discuss Gatsby's background, with Jordan suggesting that he may not have attended Oxford as he claims. The passage ends with the announcement of a musical performance and Gatsby observing the party from the steps.
