In this passage from F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," the narrator, Nick Carraway, attends one of Gatsby's extravagant parties with his friend Jordan Baker. They mingle with the other guests, including two girls in yellow and three men referred to as Mr. Mumble. The conversation turns to rumors about Gatsby, with one of the girls suggesting that he may have killed a man or been a German spy during the war. The group becomes intrigued by Gatsby and begins searching for him. They eventually find him in a library, where he shows off his collection of real books. Gatsby then reveals himself as the host of the party and excuses himself to take a phone call. Nick is surprised by Gatsby's appearance, as he expected him to be older and less refined. Jordan and Nick discuss Gatsby's background, with Jordan suggesting that he may not have attended Oxford as he claims. The passage ends with the announcement of a musical performance and Gatsby observing the party from the steps.
