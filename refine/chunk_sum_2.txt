In this passage from F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," Daisy shares with Nick her feelings about her newborn daughter, expressing a desire for her to be a "beautiful little fool" in a world that she believes is terrible. However, Nick senses the insincerity in Daisy's words and feels that she is putting on a show for him. Later, Nick visits Tom and Daisy's house and meets Jordan Baker, a friend of Daisy's. Daisy and Tom discuss Jordan and Daisy suggests that Nick and Jordan spend time together. As Nick leaves, Daisy questions him about rumors of his engagement, which he denies. He drives home and sees a figure, possibly Gatsby, standing by the water. The passage then shifts to a description of the "valley of ashes," a desolate area near the train tracks where Tom's mistress, Myrtle, lives. Tom takes Nick to meet Myrtle at a garage owned by her husband, George Wilson. Myrtle appears and Tom arranges to meet her later.
