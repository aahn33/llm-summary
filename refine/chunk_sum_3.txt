In this passage from F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," Tom Buchanan and his mistress, Myrtle Wilson, go to New York City together. Myrtle lies to her husband, George, telling him she is visiting her sister. In New York, Myrtle changes into a new dress and buys some items at a drugstore. She then expresses a desire to buy a dog, and they stop to look at puppies being sold by a man on the street. Tom corrects Myrtle when she mistakes one of the puppies for a police dog. They eventually arrive at Myrtle's small apartment, where they are joined by Myrtle's sister, Catherine, and her husband, Mr. McKee. The group drinks and socializes, with Myrtle and Catherine discussing their dissatisfaction with their marriages. Myrtle reveals that she and Tom plan to get married and move out West. Catherine also lies about her recent trip to Europe.
