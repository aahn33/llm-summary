In this passage, the narrator is momentarily distracted by the beautiful sky outside before being interrupted by Mrs. McKee. Mrs. McKee shares a personal story about almost marrying someone she considered beneath her, referring to him as a "little kike." She explains that despite others warning her about his social status, she believes that if she hadn't met her current husband, Chester, she would have ended up with the other man. This anecdote highlights Mrs. McKee's shallow and judgmental nature, as well as the societal prejudices and class distinctions present in the story.
