The United States and Liberia have had diplomatic relations for over 150 years, but these ties were strained during Liberia's civil wars in the late 20th century. The US provided humanitarian assistance and helped mediate the end of the wars. Relations improved under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and have remained close under current President George Weah. Congress has shown interest in Liberia and has provided over $2.4 billion in assistance for stabilization, recovery, and development. Congress also provided additional aid to combat the Ebola outbreak in Liberia. Some members of Congress have sought to adjust the immigration status of Liberian nationals in the US. The US and Liberia established diplomatic relations in 1864, and Liberia declared independence from the American Colonization Society. The country was dominated by an elite group until a military coup in 1980. Charles Taylor launched a rebellion in 1989, leading to years of civil war. Taylor was eventually forced to step down in 2003, and a peace agreement was reached. Liberia's wars had a negative impact on social services, the economy, and the region as a whole. Taylor was arrested in 2006 and convicted of war crimes in relation to his support for rebels in Sierra Leone. There have been calls for the establishment of a war crimes court for Liberia.
