This chunk of text discusses the timeline of events surrounding the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. It mentions that a photograph of a patient lab report showing a positive result for SARS circulated online, alerting Chinese news organizations to the significance of the situation. The World Health Organization (WHO) was triggered to take action under the International Health Regulations (IHR) after a post on ProMED, a disease outbreak reporting system. WHO requested verification from the Chinese government, and China officially began informing WHO of developments on January 3. There is some confusion about when China determined a novel coronavirus was responsible for the outbreak and when the virus' genome was sequenced. Chinese hospitals sent samples to commercial companies for analysis in late December, and one company completed genomic sequencing on December 26. The Wuhan Institute of Virology and China CDC also sequenced the genome in early January. Media reports about the sequencing breakthrough prompted WHO to announce the identification of a novel coronavirus on January 9.
