The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) supports nature-based infrastructure as part of its mandates to support, research, restore, and conserve natural resources. Nature-based infrastructure refers to engineered systems that combine natural features with structural engineering approaches. NOAA uses the terms nature-based infrastructure, natural infrastructure, and green infrastructure interchangeably. Nature-based infrastructure projects can include completely natural features or a combination of natural and hard structures. These projects provide benefits such as flood and erosion management, improved water quality, wildlife habitat, and recreation opportunities. NOAA's nature-based infrastructure activities are primarily carried out by the National Marine Fisheries Service, National Ocean Service, and Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. These activities are often related to restoration and conservation projects at the local or regional scale. The NOAA Restoration Center administers a grant program to support nature-based infrastructure activities implemented by various organizations and governments.
