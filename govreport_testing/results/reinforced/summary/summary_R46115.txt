On June 5, 2019, the SEC adopted Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), which changes broker-dealers' obligations in their relationships with retail customers. The regulation requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of the customer and address conflicts of interest. The FY2020 Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill included an amendment that would have prevented the SEC from implementing Reg BI, but it was not included in the enacted bill. This report provides background on broker-dealers and investment advisers, describes the obligations of Reg BI, examines state-based fiduciary regulations, discusses congressional concerns and actions, presents different perspectives on Reg BI, and examines research on the potential costs and benefits of the regulation. Broker-dealers act as brokers when executing trades for clients and as dealers when trading for their own benefit. They are regulated by the SEC and must be members of FINRA. Investment advisers provide direct investment advice to clients and are regulated by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
