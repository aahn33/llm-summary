This chunk of text discusses the role of border officials in facilitating lawful flow of people and goods while preventing unauthorized entries and drug smuggling. It highlights the dominance of Mexican transnational criminal organizations in the U.S. illicit drug market and their control over smuggling corridors along the U.S.-Mexico border. The text also mentions that more foreign-produced cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl flow into the country through official ports of entry (POEs) than between them, while more marijuana historically flowed between the ports. However, recent data show that more marijuana was seized at POEs than between them in FY2019. The text then focuses on the smuggling of illicit drugs between POEs, describing various smuggling methods such as underground tunnels, aerial routes, maritime vessels, and backpackers. It also mentions the debate surrounding how physical barriers along the Southwest border may impact drug smuggling.
