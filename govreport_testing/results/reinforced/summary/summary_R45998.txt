The text discusses the increasing attention given to emerging contaminants or contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in surface water and groundwater. CECs refer to unregulated substances detected in the environment that may pose a risk to human health, aquatic life, or the environment. CECs can include various manmade chemicals and substances, as well as naturally occurring substances. CECs often enter the environment through wastewater discharges and storm runoff, and treatment facilities are often not designed to remove them. The availability of data on CECs may be limited. The detection of certain CECs, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), has prompted calls for action from government and Congress. Several statutes, including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and the Clean Water Act, provide authorities to address CECs. In the 116th Congress, over 40 bills have been introduced to address PFAS. Microplastics are another group of CECs that have raised global concern, and Congress has passed legislation to ban plastic microbeads. Some stakeholders believe that the EPA could be more effective in using its existing Clean Water Act authorities to address CECs, while others suggest the need for amendments to the statute.
