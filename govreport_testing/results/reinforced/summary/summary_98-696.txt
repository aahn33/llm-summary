This text is an introduction to a report that summarizes the procedures used by the House of Representatives and the Senate to resolve legislative differences. The report is based on the interpretation of rules and precedents, and it is not an official statement of procedures. The main point is that before a bill can become law, both chambers of Congress must agree on the same measure and the same text. The selection of the measure can require parliamentary ingenuity and can have policy and political consequences. The House usually acts first on revenue measures, but in some cases, the proponents of a measure may decide which house should act first.
