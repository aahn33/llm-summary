The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) supports nature-based infrastructure as part of its mandates to support, research, restore, and conserve natural resources. Nature-based infrastructure refers to engineered systems that combine natural features with structural engineering approaches. NOAA uses the terms nature-based infrastructure, natural infrastructure, and green infrastructure interchangeably. Nature-based infrastructure projects can provide multiple benefits, such as flood and erosion management, improved water quality, wildlife habitat, and recreation opportunities. NOAA's activities supporting nature-based infrastructure include restoration and conservation projects, grant programs, technical assistance, and research. Congress may consider defining nature-based infrastructure in statute, clarifying NOAA's authority to support it, coordinating with other agencies and nonfederal entities, and tracking and reporting funding for nature-based infrastructure activities.
