The text discusses the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and its provision called "Flexibility for Equitable Per-Pupil Spending" under Title I. This provision allows the Secretary of Education to provide local educational agencies (LEAs) with the flexibility to consolidate federal funds with state and local funding to create a weighted per-pupil funding system for low-income and disadvantaged students. Currently, only Puerto Rico has been approved to implement this system. The text also discusses the financing of public education at the state and local levels, the goal of equalizing spending across LEAs, and the importance of providing equitable funding for low-income and disadvantaged students. It mentions the need for further research on the effectiveness of weighted student funding in addressing educational disparities. The text also explains the requirements and application process for LEAs interested in participating in the local flexibility demonstration agreement. It discusses the potential impact of weighted student funding on the allocation of funds under other ESEA programs and raises concerns about the targeting of funds on high-poverty schools and the assurance that the purposes of eligible federal programs will be met.
