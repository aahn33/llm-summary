The Trump Administration has proposed a budget of $44.12 billion for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) accounts for FY2021. This represents a 3% increase from the FY2020 request but a 23% decrease from the FY2020 funding level enacted by Congress. The requested funding level would be the lowest in over a decade. The Administration's priorities for funding include supporting the Indo-Pacific Strategy, countering Chinese, Russian, and Iranian influence, and maintaining American leadership in international organizations. The majority of the funding requested is for diplomatic programs, diplomatic security, and contributions to international organizations. The Administration is also proposing cuts to various development sectors, while increasing funding for programming that promotes women in developing economies. The top country recipients of foreign assistance remain consistent, with Israel, Egypt, and Jordan receiving the highest levels of aid. The Middle East and Africa would receive the largest shares of aid, followed by the Indo-Pacific and Europe and Eurasia.
