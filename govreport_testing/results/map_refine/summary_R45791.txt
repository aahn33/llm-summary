The poverty rate among Americans aged 65 and older has significantly decreased over the past 50 years, thanks to government programs like Social Security and Supplemental Security Income. However, certain groups of older Americans, such as widows, divorced women, and never married individuals, are still at risk of poverty. The official poverty measure has limitations and the Supplemental Poverty Measure has been developed as an alternative. Poverty rates among the aged population vary based on demographic characteristics, with older individuals aged 80 and older and women in this age group being particularly vulnerable. Married individuals generally have a lower poverty rate. Poverty rates also vary based on the presence of children in the family and among different racial and ethnic groups. Federal programs like Social Security and SSI aim to alleviate poverty, but may not be sufficient. The text also mentions the limitations of the official poverty measure and introduces the Supplemental Poverty Measure, which provides a more accurate measure of poverty. Social Security has the greatest impact on reducing poverty among the elderly, while medical out-of-pocket costs have the largest effect on increasing the poverty rate. The text suggests considering the economic value of health insurance programs in poverty measures for the aged population.
