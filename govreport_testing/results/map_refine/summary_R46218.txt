Border security is a complex issue that involves facilitating legal flow of people and goods while preventing unauthorized entries and drug smuggling. Mexican transnational criminal organizations are the dominant influence in the U.S. illicit drug market. Intelligence suggests that more foreign-produced drugs flow into the country through official ports of entry than between them. Marijuana is the most-seized drug by border officials, both at and between ports of entry. Smugglers use various methods to move drugs, including tunnels, ultralight aircraft, and maritime vessels. Border barriers have been implemented to deter unauthorized entry and drug smuggling, but smugglers have found ways to defeat them. Barriers may displace smuggling traffic to other areas without fencing or lead to increased maritime smuggling. The effectiveness of border barriers in deterring drug smuggling is difficult to measure due to various factors and unknown flows of drugs. Policymakers question the impact of border barriers on drug smuggling and whether they are a worthwhile investment.
