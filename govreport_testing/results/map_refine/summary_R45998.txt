The text discusses emerging contaminants, or contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), in surface water and groundwater. These unregulated substances pose a risk to human health, aquatic life, and the environment. CECs enter the environment through wastewater discharges and storm runoff, and treatment facilities are often not equipped to remove them. Data on CECs is limited, but the detection of certain substances has prompted calls for action. The EPA and states have authorities under the Clean Water Act to address CECs, but face challenges in doing so. Efforts are being made to revise and review existing guidelines, and studies are being conducted on specific types of wastewater. The EPA can address CECs through technology-based requirements and water-quality-based requirements, but challenges include gathering information and keeping up with new chemicals. The lack of data on CECs is a major challenge. Legislation is being proposed to address CECs, particularly PFAS, and improve federal coordination and research. Congress is also considering the need for more proactive actions and oversight to address gaps in the Clean Water Act. The EPA's ability to address these concerns depends on resources, technologies, and data availability. Congress may evaluate EPA appropriations and oversee program implementation.
