The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is a government-owned financial institution that supports U.S. agriculture through various programs. It operates under the supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture and has a broad mandate to carry out operations that support agriculture. CCC's activities include commodity support, export programs, resource conservation, disaster assistance, agricultural research, and bioenergy development. It is funded through its own funds, appropriations from Congress, and borrowing from the U.S. Treasury. CCC's borrowing authority is currently limited to $30 billion. The corporation's activities have expanded over time, leading to debates about its role and potential expansion. CCC's discretionary authority allows it to carry out a wide range of operations, but its use has been restricted in the past. Recent trade aid packages have utilized CCC's discretionary authority to provide assistance to farmers affected by retaliatory tariffs. However, the increase in spending has brought CCC close to its borrowing authority limit. If the limit is reached, all CCC functions and operations would be suspended. The use of CCC's discretionary authority does not require a budget offset or raise administrative PAYGO concerns.
