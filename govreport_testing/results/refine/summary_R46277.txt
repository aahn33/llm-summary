This report examines past instances in which the federal government provided assistance to troubled industries in order to inform the current debate on providing aid to industries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The report discusses the different forms of assistance that have been provided, including loan guarantees, asset purchases, capital injections, direct loans, and regulatory changes. The examples discussed in the report involve cases where federal assistance was widely available to firms within an industry, extraordinary in nature, and motivated by a desire to prevent industry-wide business failures. The report also provides data on the costs and income to the government from these assistance programs. It notes that while some assistance was repaid, it does not necessarily mean that the government "broke even" or "made a profit" due to borrowing costs and inflation adjustments. The report also highlights broader policy concerns raised by government assistance, such as potential benefits and drawbacks, and questions of fairness in providing assistance to some businesses but not others. The information in the report comes from various government reports and sources. The specific case discussed in this section is the railroad restructuring from 1957 to 1987, which involved the decline of the rail industry, bankruptcies, and the creation of Amtrak and Conrail through legislative actions. The report further explores the railroad restructuring case to provide a detailed analysis of the government's involvement. It explains that the decline of the rail industry during this period led to numerous bankruptcies and financial instability. In response, the government took legislative actions to address the crisis. This included the creation of Amtrak, a government-owned corporation that took over passenger rail services, and Conrail, a government-owned freight railroad company. These actions were aimed at preventing the complete collapse of the rail industry and ensuring the continued operation of essential transportation services. The report highlights the significance of the government's intervention in the railroad industry and its implications for the current debate on providing aid to industries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. It emphasizes the need to carefully consider the long-term consequences and potential benefits of government assistance, as well as the fairness of providing aid to certain industries while others may be left unsupported. By examining past instances of government assistance, such as the railroad restructuring, policymakers can gain valuable insights into the challenges and complexities of providing aid to troubled industries. The Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, also known as the 4R Act, was enacted to approve the USRA's "Final System Plan" and create Conrail. Conrail took over the physical infrastructure and freight operations of bankrupt railroads, including the Penn Central, and also operated commuter services. The 4R Act provided funding for Conrail and allowed for the transfer of ownership of the Penn Central's Northeast Corridor line to Amtrak. It also included reforms to ease ICC regulation of the railroad industry, such as giving railroads more flexibility in setting shipping rates and allowing them to sign contracts with large shippers. The act also created the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) loan program to assist "short line" railroads. The restructuring of the Milwaukee and Rock Island Railroads, which filed for bankruptcy in the 1970s, was addressed separately through federal legislation. The Milwaukee Railroad Restructuring Act and the Rock Island Railroad Transition and Employee Assistance Act were passed to facilitate the sale or abandonment of parts of their networks and provide worker protection provisions. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad sold two-thirds of its network and the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad ceased operations and had its former property acquired by multiple buyers. In 1980, the Staggers Rail Act was passed to further deregulate the railroad industry. It prevented the ICC from setting maximum shipping rates, allowed railroads to keep rate agreements with customers secret, and broadened the ICC's power to declare exemptions. The act also required proposals for the future of Conrail. While some provisions were unpopular with certain shippers, the law helped restore profitability to the freight rail sector and led to increased capital investment. The Northeast Rail Services Act of 1981 relieved Conrail of its obligations to provide commuter rail service in order to improve profitability. State or locally-chartered commuter authorities were required to continue operating the commuter rail lines previously run by Conrail, and a new subsidiary of Amtrak was created to take over if any state declined to do so. The act also stipulated that Conrail's status as a quasi-governmental corporation should be temporary and that the government's stake in the company should eventually be sold to private buyers. Following the reforms and privatization of Conrail, railroad profitability increased and the industry continued to consolidate and shed unprofitable lines. Conrail was eventually acquired by Norfolk Southern Corporation and CSX Corporation in 1997. Amtrak, which took over intercity passenger rail services, has never generated an operating profit and has received federal operating support every year since its creation. In the 1980s, the Farm Credit System (FCS) faced a financial crisis due to a severe downturn in the agricultural economy. The FCS had exposure to only the agriculture industry, leading to large delinquencies in its loan portfolio. The Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 authorized a $4 billion financial assistance package to stabilize the FCS. It created the FCS Financial Assistance Corporation, which utilized loans from the U.S. Treasury to repay its bonds and meet debt obligations. The act also mandated organizational changes, created an FCS Insurance Corporation, and established borrower rights for the FCS and the Farm Service Agency (FSA). The FCS Financial Assistance Corporation repaid all of its financial assistance by 2005. The FCS's financial performance improved throughout the 1990s and borrower rights provisions continue to protect farmers facing financial difficulties. The Savings and Loan Crisis of the 1980s-1990s was caused by a solvency crisis in the savings and loan industry. Rising interest rates led to higher costs for S&Ls, while their fixed-rate assets did not generate enough income. Government deposit insurance allowed insolvent S&Ls to continue operating. Regulatory forbearance and deregulation worsened the crisis. The government responded with legislation to restore solvency and resolve insolvent S&Ls. The cost of the cleanup was spread among the government, government-sponsored enterprises, and the industry. The crisis resulted in the resolution of 1,043 insolvent firms and the stabilization of the industry. The airline industry faced financial difficulties even before the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The attacks caused a decline in passenger traffic and major financial losses. Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act to provide the industry with federal financial support, including emergency assistance and guaranteed loans. During the financial crisis of 2007-2009, the government took action to assist various industries, including the air carrier, banking, and auto industries. In the air carrier industry, the Secretary of Transportation and the Comptroller General were responsible for distributing $5 billion in direct compensation to air carriers, while a board consisting of members from the Federal Reserve Board, Treasury, and Transportation oversaw the distribution of loan guarantees. The majority of the compensation was paid out to air carriers, with some funds being rescinded by Congress. The loan guarantees were approved for six airlines, with five of them fully repaying their loans and one filing for bankruptcy. The government recouped a net of $338.8 million from the loan guarantee activities. In the banking industry, the Federal Reserve injected liquidity into the financial system to address the solvency problems faced by many firms. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 gave the Treasury authority to use up to $700 billion under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to address the crisis. The Treasury created the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) to purchase preferred shares from banks, with over 700 banks participating. The Treasury recouped a significant amount of money from the sale of preferred shares, dividends, warrants, and fees, resulting in a net recoupment of $30.5 billion. In the auto industry, the financial crisis and other factors led to a decline in production and sales. The government did not pass specific legislation for the auto industry, but the Bush Administration used TARP funds to support General Motors and Chrysler. The government recouped a significant amount of money from the auto industry assistance. The first instance is the assistance provided to the auto industry during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. The Bush Administration initially provided loans to GM, Chrysler, and two auto financing companies, which were continued by the Obama Administration. The goal was to avoid bankruptcy filings, but both Chrysler and GM eventually filed for bankruptcy. The U.S. Treasury became a partial owner of both companies and gradually sold off its ownership over the following years. The second instance is the money market mutual fund guarantee program implemented in response to the market turmoil caused by the bursting of the housing bubble in 2008. The Treasury announced a program to guarantee deposits in participating money market funds to stop a run on these funds. The program was financed by the
