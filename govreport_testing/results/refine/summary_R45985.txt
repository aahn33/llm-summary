The text discusses the development and challenges of autonomous vehicles, highlighting the potential benefits of improved transportation safety. It also acknowledges the controversies surrounding legislation and regulation in Congress. The text mentions fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles, raising concerns about safety and the need for regulation. Advancements in vehicle technology, including automation features, are discussed, as well as the classification system for vehicle automation developed by the Society of Automotive Engineers. Testing and development of autonomous vehicles continue in many states and cities. The importance of cybersecurity and data privacy in autonomous vehicles is addressed, along with concerns about the collection and ownership of vehicle data. The text concludes by discussing the pathways to autonomous vehicle deployment abroad, including factors such as innovation, vehicle infrastructure, workforce training, government laws and regulations, and consumer acceptance. Examples of countries leading in autonomous vehicle readiness, such as the Netherlands and Singapore, are provided.

During the 115th Congress, both the House of Representatives and the Senate held hearings on autonomous vehicles and potential federal issues that could arise from their deployment. The House passed H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act, unanimously, while the Senate introduced S. 1885, the AV START Act. Both bills aimed to prioritize safety, promote innovation, remain technology-neutral, reinforce federal and state regulatory roles, strengthen cybersecurity, and educate the public. The bills addressed concerns about state action replacing federal regulation and included provisions for preemption of state laws. They also expanded the Department of Transportation's (DOT) exemption authority for autonomous vehicle testing and required new safety rules from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The bills differed in their approach to cybersecurity and privacy, with the House bill requiring a cybersecurity plan and privacy policies from manufacturers, while the Senate bill focused on establishing a motor vehicle privacy database. Both bills also established advisory panels for research and rulemaking. No comprehensive autonomous vehicle legislation has been introduced in the 116th Congress, but discussions on a bicameral bill are ongoing. Additionally, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works has reported a bill addressing the impact of autonomous vehicles on highway infrastructure.

The National Governors Association (NGA) has expressed concerns about the current regulatory structure and safety of autonomous vehicles. They have called for modifications in forthcoming legislation to allow states and local governments to enforce existing laws and create new regulations. The NGA also wants more detailed reports on the safety of autonomous vehicle technologies to ensure safe testing. The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) reports that many states have enacted laws related to autonomous vehicles, particularly regarding commercial activity and truck platooning. However, there have been no recent laws enacted regarding cybersecurity or vehicle inspection reports. The deployment of autonomous vehicles will require changes to highway infrastructure, including pavement markings and signage. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is expected to play a role in updating standards for traffic control devices to accommodate autonomous vehicles. However, compliance with these standards is voluntary and not all states uniformly apply them. Improving road maintenance and clearer road markings will be crucial for autonomous vehicle deployment. Additionally, there is a need for standardized communication methods between vehicles and infrastructure. The Transportation Research Board (TRB) is researching how to develop connected vehicle infrastructure. In the long term, highway markings may become less important as automakers find new ways for autonomous vehicles to navigate, such as through sensors and detailed mapping.
