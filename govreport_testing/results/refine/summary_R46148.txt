Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, relations between the United States and Iran have been confrontational. The Trump Administration has taken a series of steps to apply "maximum pressure" on Iran, including withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear agreement and imposing sanctions. Tensions have escalated since May 2019, with Iran attacking commercial ships and reducing compliance with the nuclear agreement. On December 27, 2019, a rocket attack in Iraq killed a U.S. contractor, leading to retaliatory airstrikes by the United States. Supporters of an Iran-backed Iraqi militia then surrounded the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. On January 2, 2020, the U.S. military killed Qasem Soleimani, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps-Qods Force, in a drone strike. Iran has vowed revenge for Soleimani's killing and launched ballistic missiles at Iraqi military bases housing U.S. forces. The United States is considering new sanctions on Iran, targeting its construction, mining, manufacturing, and textile sectors. Iran's approach to the JCPOA following the US's withdrawal from the agreement has been a matter of concern. Iran has threatened to exceed the limits on its nuclear activities set by the JCPOA and has since increased its nuclear activities, such as exceeding the limits on its heavy water stockpile. However, Iran has stated that it will continue to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and abide by the monitoring and inspections provisions of the JCPOA. Iran has also expressed its willingness to resume its commitments under the agreement if sanctions are removed and it benefits from the JCPOA. Additionally, Iran's support for various armed factions in the region is noteworthy. This includes Hezbollah in Lebanon, pro-Assad government forces in Syria, Iraqi militias, and the Houthis in Yemen. Iran provides these groups with funding, training, and weapons. Iran also supports other regional groups such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Al Ashtar Brigades in Bahrain, and the Afghan Taliban.

The U.S. airstrikes on Iranian-backed militia groups in Iraq have sparked protests and tensions in the country. Iraqi officials condemned the airstrikes as a violation of their sovereignty, and supporters of the militias threatened further action and vowed to expel the United States from Iraq. The death of key militia leader Abu Mahdi al Muhandis is expected to impact the relationships among Iran-aligned Iraqi militias and shape the future of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). The Iraqi government held a special session of the Council of Representatives (COR) and adopted a parliamentary decision to withdraw foreign forces from Iraq, protest the airstrikes at the United Nations, and investigate the strikes. Prime Minister Adel Abd al Mahdi requested that the United States begin working with Iraq to implement the decision, but Secretary of State Michael Pompeo stated that the U.S. mission in Iraq would continue. The U.S. military presence in Iraq is based on invitational letters from the Iraqi government and bilateral agreements, and President Trump has threatened to impose sanctions on Iraq if U.S. troops are forced to withdraw on unfriendly terms. The impact of the strike and Iraqi reactions on the U.S. military presence in Iraq and the counter-ISIS campaign is uncertain, but it could complicate relations and potentially push Iraq closer to Iran, Russia, and China.

In Iraq, there are still over 5,000 U.S. military personnel and international counterparts present at the invitation of the Iraqi government. However, Canada and Germany have announced the withdrawal of some of their training forces. The Islamic State group in Iraq has been solidifying and expanding its command and control structure, but has not increased its capabilities in areas where the Coalition is present. The Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) and other groups continue to conduct clearance and counterterrorism missions, with some operations conducted without coalition support. The ISF still heavily relies on coalition forces for air cover, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The text also mentions that a reconstituted IS threat could emerge if the ISF's weaknesses are exploited. In Syria, the status of U.S. operations against the Islamic State is not mentioned, but the absence of ongoing U.S. counterterrorism pressure could allow the group to reconstitute itself. U.S. forces in Syria have previously come into conflict with Iran-backed militia forces and may be vulnerable to additional attacks. The text also discusses the authority under which the U.S. military carried out the strike on Soleimani, with the Trump Administration citing the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 as providing the authority for the strike.

Members of Congress have had mixed reactions to the drone strike, with some supporting it as a blow to Iran's operations and others criticizing it as potentially leading to armed conflict and instability in the Middle East. Some Members, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have criticized the President for not consulting with Congress before the strike and have questioned his authority to take such military action. In response, several resolutions have been introduced in Congress to limit military action against Iran. These include S.J.Res. 63, which directs the removal of US armed forces from hostilities with Iran, and H.R. 5543 and S. 3159, which prohibit funding for military force against Iran without specific authorization. There is debate over whether these resolutions are binding on the President, with some arguing that they constitute an unconstitutional legislative veto. The use of joint resolutions, such as S.J.Res. 63, may provide a more forceful vehicle to require an end to unauthorized military action, but they are likely to be vetoed by the President.

The State Department is taking measures to protect its overseas personnel and posts in the Middle East and other regions from potential Iranian retaliation. Secretary Pompeo has acknowledged the remaining risks in the region and stated that the United States is preparing for all possibilities. The State Department is reinforcing its diplomatic facilities and deploying additional forces, including 100 Marines, to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. The Marine Security Guard detachment and other security personnel are already present at the embassy. The State Department has the authority to evaluate threats and implement security policies and programs at overseas posts. There is concern that Iran could target "soft targets" such as schools or restaurants frequented by diplomats or their families. The State Department may also choose to close or change the status of an overseas post based on threat assessments. The killing of Qasem Soleimani has implications for Israel's security, as Israel and Iran are already engaged in low-level conflict. Israel has been placed on high alert, but Israeli officials doubt that Iran would target Israel directly. There is also concern that Iran could retaliate against Jewish targets worldwide. The European Union opposes the U.S. decision to withdraw from the JCPOA but shares concerns about Iran's ballistic missile program and support for terrorism. European leaders have called for de-escalation and expressed concern about Iran's destabilizing behavior. European countries have also criticized Iran for alleged plots to assassinate dissidents in Europe. The United States has increased its military force posture in the region since May 2019, adding forces and military capabilities. These deployments are seen as defensive measures to respond to aggression if necessary. The recent regional deployments align with the broader U.S. strategy of competing with China and Russia, which are viewed as the key national security priorities. However, Iran remains a significant challenge in the CENTCOM area of responsibility. Some observers question the feasibility of the strategic reprioritization and the potential risks associated with diverting resources away from CENTCOM.

The recent deployments of U.S. troops have the potential to impact military readiness and global basing. While the number of additional troops deployed has been relatively small, unforeseen threats and contingencies could require even more forces, putting pressure on the U.S. military. Deploying troops to the CENTCOM area of responsibility would reduce the availability of forces for other potential contingencies. The basing of U.S. troops in foreign countries is a sensitive issue, as it challenges the host nation's sovereignty. Recent events, such as the Soleimani strike and Iranian counter-strikes, could complicate negotiations on U.S. forward bases, which are already sensitive due to burden-sharing issues. There are concerns about whether the U.S. government is adequately prepared for hybrid and irregular warfare, which involves collaboration with proxies and deliberate confusion between civilian and military activities. Iran heavily relies on proxy forces to achieve its objectives, and these groups engage in malign activities to undermine U.S. interests. Some believe that the U.S.-Iranian conflict will primarily involve irregular/hybrid warfare, but there are concerns that the Trump Administration's focus on great power competition may lead to insufficient attention and resources being dedicated to preparing for this type of warfare. Additionally, there are concerns about the organization and resources of nonmilitary institutions like the State Department, which play a crucial role in countering such tactics from adversaries.
