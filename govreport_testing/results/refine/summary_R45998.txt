The text discusses emerging contaminants, or contaminants of emerging concern (CECs), in surface water and groundwater. CECs are unregulated substances detected in the environment that may pose a risk to human health, aquatic life, or the environment. These contaminants can come from various sources, including wastewater discharges and storm runoff. The availability of data on CECs is often limited. The detection of certain CECs, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and microplastics, has prompted calls for action from government and Congress. The Clean Water Act (CWA) provides authorities to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and states to address CECs. EPA has several CWA authorities it can use to address CECs, including technology-based effluent limitations and water-quality-based effluent limitations. The CWA also allows EPA to designate contaminants as toxic pollutants or hazardous substances. EPA has the responsibility to establish Effluent Limitation Guidelines and Standards (ELGs) for non-POTW dischargers. EPA periodically reviews and revises these guidelines. The text also mentions ongoing studies and initiatives related to CECs, such as the management of oil and gas extraction wastewater and the study of PFAS and nutrients.

The text further highlights the importance of managing oil and gas extraction wastewater as part of the efforts to address emerging contaminants. This wastewater can contain various pollutants, including CECs, which can potentially contaminate surface water and groundwater. The management of this wastewater involves implementing proper treatment and disposal methods to minimize the environmental impact.

Additionally, the text mentions the study of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and nutrients as ongoing initiatives related to CECs. PFAS are a group of synthetic chemicals widely used in industrial and consumer products, and their presence in the environment has raised concerns due to their persistence and potential health effects. Nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, can also contribute to water pollution and the formation of harmful algal blooms, which can have detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems.

The text then discusses options for addressing Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) through technology-based requirements under the Clean Water Act (CWA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and states have the authority to address CECs through technology-based effluent limitations using Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELGs) or by setting technology-based effluent limits in National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits on a case-by-case basis. The EPA can also add contaminants to the Toxic Pollutant List. ELGs are developed for industrial categories, not specific pollutants, but the EPA can initiate a review of particular pollutants to prioritize further study and potential ELG development. Technology-based effluent limits can be imposed in NPDES permits when EPA-promulgated effluent limitations are inapplicable. The EPA can designate contaminants as toxic pollutants and establish effluent limitations for those pollutants. Adding a pollutant to the Toxic Pollutant List triggers additional requirements for states. However, there are challenges in addressing CECs, including the need for extensive supporting information, difficulty in keeping pace with new chemicals, lack of analytical methods and data, and time constraints for issuing regulations. Water quality standards and criteria are also discussed, with states required to adopt and review their own standards based on EPA recommendations.

The text discusses options for addressing Contaminants of Emerging Concern (CECs) through water-quality-based requirements. It explains that EPA and states can establish water quality criteria for CECs, but states are not necessarily required to adopt these criteria. The primary tool for achieving water quality standards is to limit or prohibit discharges of the contaminant in NPDES permits. If a water body is not meeting its designated use, a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) can be used to establish a "pollution diet" for the water body. However, addressing CECs through water-quality-based requirements can be challenging due to a lack of data on their occurrence and effects. Developing new criteria can also be time-consuming. The text also discusses the designation of CECs as toxic pollutants or hazardous substances under the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the implications of these designations on the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). Finally, it mentions legislation in the 116th Congress that focuses on addressing CECs, particularly PFAS, through CWA authorities and other measures.

The text discusses the current debate in Congress regarding the concerns related to widespread detections of PFAS, as well as the increasing attention to other emerging contaminants such as microplastics and algal toxins. It highlights the need for federal actions to address these contaminants to be more proactive rather than reactive. The text also mentions the need for oversight to identify and address potential gaps or barriers in the Clean Water Act (CWA) authorities and processes that make it difficult for the EPA and states to quickly respond to the detection of contaminants. It suggests that EPA could better use its existing authorities, such as updating its effluent limitations guidelines and prioritizing which contaminants warrant water quality criteria development. The ability of EPA to address these recommendations depends on resources, treatment technologies, and scientific and economic data. Congress may evaluate EPA appropriations for CWA programs and oversee the Administration's implementation of these programs.
