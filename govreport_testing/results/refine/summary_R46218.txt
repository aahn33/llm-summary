Border officials have the responsibility of facilitating the lawful flow of people and goods while preventing unauthorized entries and the smuggling of illicit drugs. Mexican transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) dominate the U.S. illicit drug market and control smuggling corridors along the Southwest border. Intelligence suggests that more foreign-produced cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl flow into the country through official ports of entry (POEs) than between them. CBP seizure data indicate that more marijuana was seized at POEs than between them in FY2019. Smugglers use various methods to move illicit drugs between POEs, including underground tunnels, ultralight aircraft, maritime vessels, and backpackers. The construction of physical barriers along the Southwest border has been cited as a way to deter drug smuggling, but smugglers may respond by changing their methods and routes. Mexican traffickers use subterranean tunnels to smuggle drugs, and border officials have invested in technology to detect and confirm these tunnels. Traffickers have also moved drugs over border barriers using methods such as launching bundles from compressed air cannons and using ultralight aircraft and drones. Smugglers have found ways to defeat physical barriers, including cutting holes and bribing border officials. Border barriers may displace drug smuggling to other areas without fencing, and there have been reports of an increase in maritime smuggling along the San Diego coast. The addition or enhancement of border barriers could lead some smugglers to move their contraband through POEs, and more drugs are already being moved through POEs than between them.

The text discusses the question of how border barriers may affect drug smuggling between points of entry (POEs) in the United States. The exact quantity of illicit drugs flowing into the country is unknown, making it difficult to analyze the impact of border barriers on drug smuggling. Border barriers are just one component of border security, and isolating their effects from other factors such as technology and personnel is challenging. Factors such as demand and supply for drugs, the type of drug being shipped, terrain and climate conditions, and smuggler counterintelligence functions also play a role in drug smuggling. Policymakers are interested in how the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) identifies and evaluates changes in drug smuggling, including linking drug seizure data to border security efforts. They also question how DHS defines the success or effectiveness of border barriers and whether they contribute to gathering intelligence for the drug-control community.
