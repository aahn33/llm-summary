The text discusses the relationship between the United States and the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), highlighting their historical ties and the support the United States has provided for their independence and membership in NATO and the EU. The United States and the Baltic states work closely together in various areas, including diplomacy, security, defense, and economics. The focus on the Baltic region has increased since 2014 due to concerns about potential threats from Russia. Congress supports maintaining close relations and security cooperation with the Baltic states. The Baltic states, consisting of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, were severely impacted by the 2008-2009 global economic crisis, experiencing significant economic contractions and social costs. However, the Baltic economies have since rebounded, with strong domestic consumption, external demand for exports, and investment growth. Each of the Baltic states has adopted the euro as its currency and maintains public finances within EU guidelines. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in the region remains below pre-crisis levels, with Sweden being the largest foreign investor. The banking sector in the Baltic states has faced concerns regarding money laundering, with two major scandals in 2018 drawing attention to the issue. The United States has a strong relationship with the Baltic states, considering them reliable allies and providing significant security assistance. The U.S. has also shown support for economic ties, although economic relations between the U.S. and the Baltic states remain relatively limited. The text discusses regional security concerns in the Baltic states and the responses to these concerns. It highlights the increasing signs of Russian foreign policy assertiveness in the region, including military buildups, exercises, and incursions into Baltic states' airspace. While the Baltic states are members of NATO, Russia's actions allow it to test NATO solidarity and credibility. The defense capabilities of the Baltic states are limited, and they heavily rely on NATO membership for defense planning. However, they have increased their defense budgets and sought to acquire new military capabilities. The United States has bolstered security cooperation in the region through the European Deterrence Initiative, which involves increased military presence, exercises, and infrastructure improvements. NATO has also deployed multinational battle groups to the Baltic states to deter Russian aggression. The Baltic states rely on their NATO allies for air policing, and concerns about hybrid threats, disinformation campaigns, and the treatment of ethnic Russians in the Baltic states are also discussed. The text discusses two main concerns for the Baltic states: cyberattacks and energy security. In terms of cyberattacks, Estonia experienced a series of coordinated attacks in 2007, prompting the country to strengthen its cyber defenses and become a hub for cybersecurity cooperation within NATO. Lithuania also adopted a national Cyber Security Strategy and registered over 53,000 cybersecurity incidents in 2018. In terms of energy security, the Baltic states have been heavily dependent on Russia for natural gas, raising concerns about political and economic leverage. However, efforts have been made to diversify energy sources, including the operation of a floating LNG terminal in Lithuania and the development of pipelines and interconnectivity with other European countries. The Baltic states' power grids are also being synchronized with the wider European electricity market. The United States has shown interest in European energy security and has encouraged diversification of supply. Overall, the Baltic states are likely to remain strong allies and security partners for the United States, particularly in areas such as deterring Russian aggression, NATO, energy security, and economic issues.
