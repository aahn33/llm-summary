The rapid growth of leveraged lending has caught the attention of policymakers due to its similarities with the mortgage lending and mortgage-backed securities markets prior to the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Leveraged lending involves providing loans to highly indebted companies for various purposes such as buyouts, mergers, and debt refinancing. This type of lending is supported by a range of institutions including banks, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and private investment funds. To spread the risk, these loans are often divided among multiple lenders through syndication or participation arrangements.

One significant aspect of leveraged lending is the role of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). These are securities that are backed by the cash flow generated from pools of leveraged loans. In fact, CLOs account for over 60% of investment in the leveraged lending market. The migration of leveraged lending activity from banks to nonbank institutions has raised concerns about systemic risk and the need for effective regulation.

CLOs are structured as separate legal entities and have portfolio managers responsible for constructing and managing the loan portfolios. They are sold in different tranches with varying payment priorities and credit ratings, redistributing the credit risk. Institutional investors, such as asset managers, banks, and insurance companies, hold CLOs.

The rapid growth of leveraged lending has raised concerns about the potential impact on the economy during a downturn, as a slowdown in leveraged loan issuance could limit financing for nonfinancial companies and lead to reduced capital spending. This could exacerbate an economic downturn if heavily indebted firms experience a debt overhang and struggle to take on new debt.

The leveraged lending market has experienced rapid growth, with approximately $1.15 trillion of leveraged loans outstanding at the end of 2018. Mutual funds, banks, and insurance companies hold significant shares of these loans, while CLOs hold the majority. This concentration of leveraged loans in certain institutions further highlights the potential risks associated with this market.

Leveraged loans and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) present risks to investors and overall financial stability. Both leveraged loans and CLOs pose credit risk to investors, as borrowers are typically highly indebted and have low credit ratings. However, leveraged loans have historically had lower default rates and higher recovery rates than high-yield bonds. CLOs redistribute credit risk through their tranched structure, with senior tranches receiving higher credit ratings. There is concern that default rates could spike if economic conditions worsen or interest rates rise. The main policy concern is whether problems with leveraged loans could lead to broader financial instability. During the financial crisis, problems with mortgage-backed securities (MBS) demonstrated how a class of securities can pose systemic risk. While leveraged loans and CLOs share some similarities with MBS, there are important differences. It is not clear whether unexpected losses in leveraged lending would lead to broader systemic deleveraging or problems for systemically important institutions. There is also a potential liquidity mismatch for certain holders of leveraged loans. Leveraged loan regulation varies based on the type of institution and activity involved. Banks are subject to supervision and guidance, while nonbank participants have less oversight. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) monitors risk but has not recommended regulatory changes for leveraged lending.

The regulations applicable to holding leveraged loans or collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) vary depending on the type of entity involved. Banks face prudential regulations such as capital requirements and the Volcker Rule, which restricts certain risky activities. Banks must also comply with leverage and risk-weighted ratios when holding leveraged loans or CLOs. They are subject to periodic examination by federal bank regulators and must report data on syndicated loans larger than $100 million. Asset management firms in the industry are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and must adhere to disclosure requirements, investor access restrictions, examinations, and risk mitigation controls. Investment funds in the leveraged lending and CLO markets may be subject to additional requirements based on whether they are public or private funds. Insurance companies are regulated at the state level and must meet risk-based capital requirements. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners assigns risk assessments to assets, including leveraged loans and CLOs, which determine the limits on insurers' holdings. The securitization process to create CLOs is regulated through risk-retention rules, which require CLO managers to retain a portion of the assets to align their interests with investors. CLOs are also subject to federal securities laws, and CLO managers must register as investment advisers and comply with SEC requirements. The status of the bank regulators' leveraged loan guidance is currently under debate, with questions about whether it qualifies as a binding regulation and whether it has been submitted to Congress for review.

The House Financial Services Committee recently held a hearing to discuss the systemic risk of leveraged lending. During the hearing, two draft bills were considered. The first bill, called the Leveraged Lending Data and Analysis Act, would require the Office of Financial Research to gather information and assess risks related to leveraged lending, and then make recommendations in a report to Congress. The second bill, known as the Leveraged Lending Examination Enhancement Act, would require the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council to establish prudential standards for leveraged lending by depository institutions. Additionally, this bill would require quarterly reporting on leveraged lending by depository institutions. These proposed bills aim to address the potential risks associated with leveraged lending and provide greater oversight and regulation in this area.
