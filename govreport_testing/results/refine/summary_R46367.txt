The Trump Administration has proposed a budget of $44.12 billion for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) accounts for FY2021. This is about 3% higher than the FY2020 request but nearly 23% below the FY2020 funding level enacted by Congress. The requested funding level would be the lowest in over a decade. The appropriations process has been shaped by the Budget Control Act of 2011, which has imposed spending caps on discretionary spending. Congress has raised the caps and used Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding to work around the limits. The Administration has not requested OCO funds for SFOPS since FY2018. The FY2021 request would cut funding for the Department of State and Related Agency appropriations accounts by 18.9%. The Administration's priorities for funding include supporting the Indo-Pacific Strategy, countering Chinese, Russian, and Iranian influence, and maintaining American leadership in international organizations. The majority of the funding requested is for diplomatic programs, diplomatic security, and contributions to international organizations. The Administration is also proposing a standalone Worldwide Security Protection account and requesting funding for the State Department's diplomatic security accounts.

The proposed budget for the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs (SFOPS) accounts for FY2021 is significantly lower than the funding level enacted by Congress in FY2020. This decrease in funding is due to the spending caps imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. In the past, Congress has raised these caps and used Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funding to bypass the limits. However, the Trump Administration has not requested OCO funds for SFOPS since FY2018. As a result, the FY2021 request would cut funding for the Department of State and Related Agency appropriations accounts by 18.9%, making it the lowest funding level in over a decade.

Despite the reduced budget, the Administration has outlined its priorities for funding. These include supporting the Indo-Pacific Strategy, countering the influence of China, Russia, and Iran, and maintaining American leadership in international organizations. The majority of the requested funding is allocated to diplomatic programs, diplomatic security, and contributions to international organizations. Additionally, the Administration is proposing a standalone Worldwide Security Protection account and requesting funding for the State Department's diplomatic security accounts.

The FY2021 foreign operations request proposes allocating funds to development sectors other than global health, independent agencies, multilateral assistance, and export promotion agencies. The budget request would reduce funding in various development sectors, such as environment-focused aid, education, and water and sanitation. However, there would be a significant increase in funding for programs that promote women in developing economies. The request also includes the creation of a new Economic Support and Development Fund (ESDF) that would consolidate several development accounts. The request would reduce funding to independent agencies like the Peace Corps and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, and proposes eliminating the Inter-American Foundation and the U.S African Development Foundation. Multilateral assistance accounts would also be reduced, with the proposal to eliminate funding for the International Organizations and Programs account. The request includes increased investment in the U.S. Development Finance Corporation but would eliminate funding for the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. The top country recipients of foreign assistance would remain consistent with previous years, with Israel, Egypt, and Jordan receiving the most aid. The Middle East and Africa would receive the largest shares of aid, followed by the Indo-Pacific and Europe and Eurasia. The distribution of assistance within regions varies significantly. The International Affairs budget includes funding for international food assistance programs and certain international commissions.
