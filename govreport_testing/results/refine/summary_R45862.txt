The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) added a new part to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) called "Flexibility for Equitable Per-Pupil Spending." This allows the Secretary of Education to provide local educational agencies (LEAs) with the flexibility to consolidate federal funds with state and local funding to create a single school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations for low-income and disadvantaged students. Under this system, weights are assigned to different pupil characteristics, such as low-income status or having a disability, and school budgets are based on these weighted pupil counts. The Secretary can waive certain requirements for LEAs implementing this system, but they must still meet requirements for allocations to schools with low-income and English Learner students. The Title I-E authority is currently limited to 50 LEAs, but this may change in the future. The report also provides an overview of how public elementary and secondary education is financed at the state and local levels, including the use of weighted student funding.

The text discusses the application of the weighted student funding concept to intra-LEA budgeting for schools. This concept involves developing and implementing individual school budgets based on weighted counts of the students currently enrolled in each school. The budgets are adjusted when students transfer from one school to another. The use of weighted student funding within LEAs is a relatively new practice, and preliminary findings suggest that LEAs implementing weighted student funding systems cite equity and flexibility for school principals as main reasons for doing so. The Title I-E authority under the ESEA provides LEAs with flexibility to consolidate eligible federal funds with state and local funding to create a single school funding system based on weighted per-pupil allocations for low-income and otherwise disadvantaged students. Participating LEAs must continue to meet certain statutory requirements, such as fiscal accountability and provisions related to the participation of eligible children enrolled in private schools. While the Secretary has the power to waive some requirements, there are certain ones that cannot be waived, such as state-level requirements and addressing disparities in teacher quality. LEAs interested in participating in the local flexibility demonstration agreement must submit an application that includes a description of their weighted student funding system, funding sources, and assurances that they will meet various requirements. Currently, the Secretary is permitted to enter into agreements with up to 50 LEAs, but beginning with the 2019-2020 school year, the funding flexibility may be extended to any LEA that meets certain requirements.

The possible interactions between the Title I-E authority and other ESEA programs are discussed. The main focus is on the Title I-A program, which receives the majority of the funding and is the only program where funds are allocated to individual schools based on statutory school allocation policies. The current policies for allocating Title I-A funds within LEAs prioritize schools with high concentrations of students from low-income families. However, under the Title I-E authority, funds can be combined with state and local funds and follow students to any public school in the LEA. This represents a significant shift in how the program is implemented. The allocation of Title I-A funds is based on various measures of low-income status, such as eligibility for free and reduced-price school lunches. Many Title I-A schools do not have high percentages of low-income students compared to the national average. Funds are allocated to participating schools based on the number of students from low-income families, with the option for higher grants per child for schools with higher percentages of low-income students. Private schools also receive a share of funds based on the number of low-income students in the residential areas served by selected public schools. The amount of funding per student from a low-income family is relatively low and can only finance a substantial level of services when combined with funding for numerous eligible students in a school. Other ESEA programs may also be affected by the Title I-E authority, depending on the percentage of funds allocated through the weighted student funding formula.

The implementation of the weighted student funding authority could result in less targeting of Title I-A funds on high-poverty schools. Currently, Title I-A funds are primarily allocated to specific schools with high concentrations of low-income students. However, under the Title I-E flexibility authority, funds would be provided to any public school that enrolls even one low-income student. While it is difficult to compare the current allocation of funds to how they might be allocated under the weighted student funding authority, there would be a contrast in allocation strategies. The current structure of Title I-A is based on the assumption that concentrations of poverty correlate with concentrations of low-achieving students. Proponents argue that limited funds should be concentrated on the highest-poverty schools to address the greatest needs. However, under the weighted student funding authority, funds would likely be more dispersed among schools. This could be countered by combining Title I-A funds with state and local funds, as well as other eligible federal program funds, and giving additional weight to students from low-income families. While Title I-A funds alone may be more widely dispersed, total funding to high-poverty schools could increase. The Title I-E flexibility authority may also result in other federal programs becoming more focused on individual schools. The reporting requirements under the ESEA would provide data on the allocation of federal funds at the school level. The weighted student funding authority represents a major change in strategy for Title I-A and other potentially affected programs, transforming it from a school-based program to an individualized grant. The authority waives certain requirements for targeting schools or uses of funds, reducing administrative burdens but also potentially impacting services for students with the greatest needs. The provisions of Title I-E aim to ensure that the purposes of eligible programs are met, but it may be challenging for participating LEAs initially as more federal funding is provided to the school level and Title I-A funds are used in schools that had not previously received them.
