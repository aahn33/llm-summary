The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) supports nature-based infrastructure, which combines natural features with structural engineering approaches, to support, research, restore, and conserve natural resources. These projects provide benefits such as flood and erosion management, improved water quality, wildlife habitat, and recreation opportunities. NOAA's nature-based infrastructure activities are primarily carried out by its line offices, involving restoration and conservation projects, grant programs, technical assistance, and research. Congress may consider defining nature-based infrastructure in statute, clarifying NOAA's authority, coordinating with other federal agencies, and funding these activities.

The text discusses the coordination of nature-based infrastructure activities by NOAA, including collaboration with federal and nonfederal partners and involvement in interagency and interorganizational efforts. Congress may consider directing NOAA to manage these activities within the agency or with external organizations. NOAA's spending on nature-based infrastructure activities is not specifically tracked, and Congress may consider requiring reporting of expenditures. Stakeholders have different views on how Congress should fund these activities, with options including appropriating funds for existing or new NOAA programs or creating grant programs. Several bills in the 116th Congress address funding for nature-based infrastructure activities.
