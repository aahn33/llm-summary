The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is a government-owned entity responsible for federal farm commodity price support and production programs. It operates under the supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture and supports U.S. agriculture through various programs. CCC's funding structure includes its own funds, appropriations from Congress, and borrowing. It has a borrowing limit of $30 billion, which has not been increased since 1987. CCC's expenditures include both outlays and receipts, and it also incurs net realized losses that are not recoverable. The annual appropriation for CCC is based on the net realized losses of the previous year. CCC is a government-owned financial institution that supports U.S. agriculture through various activities, including export credit guarantee programs and disaster aid. It also allocates funds to support transportation costs and administrative costs for foreign commodity donations through its relationship with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). While there has been a debate about expanding CCC's activities, some arguing it goes beyond its original mission, others prefer the stability of mandatory funding. Restrictions on CCC's use have been imposed in the past, but the FY2018 omnibus appropriation removed these limitations. CCC has administrative discretion to carry out operations that support U.S. agriculture, and this discretion has been used for various purposes in the past. In 2018 and 2019, USDA used its administrative discretion to authorize trade aid packages totaling $12 billion and $16 billion, respectively. Congressional support for CCC's discretionary authority varies depending on the purpose. CCC's existence and operations are often misunderstood, and it operates through USDA agencies. The mandatory funding nature of CCC activities makes it an attractive funding mechanism, but any expansion of mandatory funding authority may require a spending/revenue offset. The use of CCC's discretionary authority for trade aid packages has increased its spending and brought it close to its borrowing authority limit of $30 billion. If this limit is reached, all CCC functions and operations would be suspended.
