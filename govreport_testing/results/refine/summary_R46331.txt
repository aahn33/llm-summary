This report discusses selected health care-related provisions that are set to expire during the second session of the 116th Congress in 2020. These provisions are related to Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and private health insurance programs and activities. The report also includes provisions enacted in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) or extended under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The report categorizes the provisions into two types: those that provide or control mandatory spending and those that define the authority of government agencies or entities to act. The report excludes provisions associated with discretionary spending activities and certain transitional or routine provisions. The report provides tables listing the relevant provisions scheduled to expire in 2020 and those that expired in 2019, along with their legislative history. The report also includes appendices listing demonstration projects and pilot programs related to health care and abbreviations used in the report. One specific provision discussed in the report is the Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education Program, which provides funding for education on abstaining from sexual activity outside of marriage. The funding for this program is set to expire after November 30, 2020. Another provision discussed is the Personal Responsibility Education Program, which aims to educate adolescents on abstinence and contraceptives to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. The report provides background information, relevant legislation, and the current status of these provisions. Additionally, the report highlights the importance of these provisions in promoting sexual health education and preventing unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections among adolescents. It emphasizes the need for continued funding and support for these programs to ensure the well-being of young individuals.

The text discusses various pieces of legislation and their funding allocations for different healthcare programs. The first program mentioned is the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP), which was established under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and received funding from FY2010 through FY2019. The funding for PREP was also provided under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019. However, the funding for PREP expires after November 30, 2020. 

The text then moves on to discuss the Quality Measure Selection program, which is required under the Social Security Act (SSA). The funding for this program was provided under various pieces of legislation, including the ACA, PAMA, MACRA, BBA 2018, Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019, and the CARES Act. Similar to PREP, the funding for the Quality Measure Selection program also expires after November 30, 2020.

Next, the text mentions the contract with a consensus-based entity for performance measurement, which is also required under the SSA. The funding for this contract was provided under MIPPA, ATRA, PSRA, PAMA, MACRA, BBA 2018, Continuing Appropriations Act, 2020, and Health Extenders Act of 2019, and the CARES Act. Again, the funding for this contract expires after November 30, 2020.

The text further discusses relevant legislation and current status updates for various Medicare provisions. The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI) floor has been extended multiple times through different acts, with the current extension set to expire after November 30, 2020. The Home Health Prospective Payment System Rural Add-On for High Utilization Counties provides increased payments to federally certified home health agencies for Medicare home health care episodes furnished in rural areas. The add-on payment percentages vary based on the year and the designation of the rural county. The add-on payment for services provided in high utilization rural counties will no longer be available after December 31, 2020. The Outreach and Assistance for Low-Income Programs provides funding for outreach and assistance activities to Medicare beneficiaries, particularly those who may be eligible for low-income subsidy programs. The funding for these programs has been extended multiple times, with the most recent extension through November 30, 2020, under the CARES Act.

For low-income Medicare beneficiary outreach and education activities, funding has been provided through various acts such as MIPPA, ACA, ATRA, PSRA, PAMA, MACRA, BBA 2018, Continuing Appropriations Act 2020, and CARES Act. The funding amounts and program extensions vary for each act, with the most recent extension provided by the CARES Act until November 30, 2020.

Regarding spousal impoverishment protections for Medicaid recipients of home and community-based services (HCBS), the ACA initially required states to extend these protections to all married individuals eligible for HCBS. The authority for these protections has been extended multiple times by acts such as the Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019, Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act of 2019, Sustaining Excellence in Medicaid Act of 2019, Further Consolidated Appropriations Act 2020, and CARES Act. However, the authority for the extension will expire after November 30, 2020.

For the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the E-FMAP rate determines the federal government's share of CHIP expenditures. The ACA increased the E-FMAP rate for most CHIP expenditures from FY2016 to FY2019. The increase was extended through FY2020 by the Making further continuing appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 act. However, the increase to the E-FMAP rate will expire after September 30, 2020.

The Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) provides mandatory funding for federal health centers authorized in the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) Section 330. The CHCF has been a significant source of funding for health center programs. However, the current status of the CHCF is not mentioned in the text.

The text discusses the relevant legislation and current status of three healthcare funding programs: the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), the Special Diabetes Programs, and the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Appropriations. The CHCF has received funding from various acts, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the CARES Act, with funding authorized until November 30, 2020. The Special Diabetes Programs, which fund research and services related to diabetes, have received funding from multiple acts, with funding also authorized until November 30, 2020. The NHSC, which provides scholarships and loan repayments to healthcare professionals, has received funding from the ACA and the CARES Act, with funding authorized until November 30, 2020. Any unused grants awarded prior to this date will remain available.

The text provides information on several relevant legislations and their current status. The Teaching Health Center program, which provides funding for direct and indirect GME payments, has received funding through various acts such as the ACA, MACRA, and BBA 2018. The current funding authorized under the CARES Act expires after November 30, 2020. The Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC) subsidizes health insurance for eligible taxpayers and is authorized under the Trade Act of 2002. The authorization for the HCTC is scheduled to expire after December 31, 2020. The Pregnancy Assistance Fund (PAF) program, which supports expectant and parenting individuals, was established under the ACA and its funding expired after September 30, 2019. Funding for the implementation of Section 101 of MACRA, which made changes to Medicare payments to physicians, has not been enacted for FY2020 or subsequent years. The funding for measure development under SSA Section 1848(s) and the temporary extension of the LTCH site neutral payment policy transition period have also not been enacted for FY2020 or subsequent years.

The text discusses two separate issues related to Medicare payments. The first issue pertains to payments for inpatient hospital care at Long-Term Care Hospitals (LTCHs). Medicare pays LTCHs under the LTCH PPS, which is typically higher than payments under the IPPS. However, certain discharges do not qualify for the LTCH PPS rate and instead receive a site neutral payment rate. The 21st Century Cures Act established an additional temporary criterion for payment under the LTCH PPS for certain spinal cord conditions, but this authority expired for discharges occurring in FY2020 and subsequent years.

The second issue concerns Medicare payments for radiation therapy services provided by physicians and non-physician practitioners. Currently, payments are made based on a fee schedule that assigns relative values to service codes. The ACA requires the HHS Secretary to periodically identify potentially misvalued services and make appropriate adjustments to the relative values. Certain radiation therapy codes were identified as potentially misvalued in 2015, and CMS created new codes during the transition to an episodic alternative payment model. The Patient Access and Medicare Protection Act (PAMPA) required CMS to maintain the same code definitions and payment rates for these transition codes in CY2017 and CY2018. PAMPA also instructed the HHS Secretary to report on the development of an
