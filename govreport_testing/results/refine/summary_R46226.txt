The United States and Liberia have had diplomatic relations for over 150 years. In the 20th century, the relationship was strained during Liberia's civil wars, but improved during the tenure of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and has remained close under current President George Weah. Congress has shown interest in Liberia and has provided over $2.4 billion in assistance since the end of the second civil war. Aid has focused on promoting good governance, strengthening the rule of law, reforming the security sector, improving service delivery, and spurring economic development. Congress has also provided additional assistance to combat the Ebola outbreak in Liberia. The historical background of Liberia includes its establishment as a settlement for freed slaves and freeborn African-Americans, followed by a period of economic mismanagement, corruption, and repression. The country experienced two civil wars, with Charles Taylor playing a significant role. The wars devastated the economy and led to instability in the region. President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf oversaw a postwar transition marked by political stability and economic growth, but faced challenges such as extreme poverty, corruption scandals, and failure to implement key recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In the 2017 elections, George Weah, a former professional soccer player, won the presidency. The United States and other donors provided substantial support for the elections. The administration of Liberian President George Weah is facing mounting pressures due to weak economic growth, poor tax administration, declining donor aid, and the departure of the UN mission in Liberia (UNMIL). These factors have led to surging inflation, a depreciation of the Liberian dollar, falling purchasing power, rising poverty, and a food security crisis. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved a four-year program to support macroeconomic adjustments and reforms, including austerity measures. However, these policies may be unpopular domestically, and it remains to be seen if the Weah administration will continue to pursue politically challenging reforms. Corruption is a longstanding concern in Liberia, and efforts to address it may face pushback from officials who profit from the current system. Recent protests and inflammatory rhetoric have raised concerns about political tensions in the country. The United States maintains close ties with Liberia and is likely to continue supporting its development, although aid allocations may decrease. However, mismanagement of donor assistance and other challenges may be of concern to some Members of Congress. The effectiveness of various tools for advancing U.S. interests in Liberia, including diplomacy, foreign assistance, and punitive measures, may continue to be debated.
