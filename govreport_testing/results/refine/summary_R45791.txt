The poverty rate among Americans aged 65 and older has decreased significantly over the past 50 years, from 28.5% in 1966 to 9.2% in 2017. This decline can be attributed to government programs such as Social Security and Supplemental Security Income. However, certain groups of older Americans, such as widows, divorced women, and never married individuals, are still vulnerable to poverty. The official poverty measure used to determine poverty status has limitations, such as not considering in-kind benefits and not accurately reflecting current costs of basic needs. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) has been developed as an alternative measure. Poverty rates among older Americans vary based on age, gender, marital status, and race and Hispanic origin. Older individuals aged 80 and older have a higher poverty rate, and women in this age group have the highest poverty rate among elderly women and men. Married individuals generally have a lower poverty rate compared to those who are not married. Poverty rates also vary based on the presence of children in the family and by race and Hispanic origin. The poverty rate is lowest among non-Hispanic white individuals and highest among black individuals.

The main federal programs that provide cash benefits to the aged poor are Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Social Security accounted for the majority of income among aged individuals below the poverty threshold, while SSI and other cash public assistance accounted for a smaller portion. Social Security benefits are weighted to provide more support for low-paid workers, but alone they would not be sufficient to eliminate poverty for many older Americans. SSI provides monthly cash benefits to aged individuals with limited income and assets, but it may not effectively protect the oldest Americans from poverty. The federal government also provides noncash benefits such as housing subsidies and SNAP benefits to help the elderly poor. The Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) was developed to address the limitations of the official poverty measure and includes factors such as taxes, noncash benefits, and certain expenses. The SPM poverty rate for persons aged 65 and older was higher than the official poverty rate, largely due to higher medical out-of-pocket costs. Social Security has the greatest impact on reducing poverty among the aged population, followed by SSI, housing subsidies, and SNAP. Medical out-of-pocket costs had the largest effect on the poverty rate. The poverty status of the institutionalized population, such as those in nursing homes, is not measured. Health status is indirectly considered in poverty measures, but the overall value of health insurance programs is not fully accounted for.
