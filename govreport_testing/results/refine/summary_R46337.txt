This report provides an overview of the major statutory provisions governing the sale and export of U.S. defense articles to foreign countries. The sale of defense articles is governed by a complex set of laws, regulations, and international agreements. The main statutes covering these sales are the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 (AECA). The report describes two main programs for sales and exports: Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS). FMS involves the U.S. government acting as a broker to procure defense articles for sales to foreign countries, while DCS does not involve the U.S. government as a broker but still requires licensing. The report also discusses the role of Congress in approving or restricting these sales. In FY2018, the value of authorized U.S. arms sales to foreign governments and export licenses issued totaled about $184.3 billion. The report also mentions security assistance and security cooperation programs, which are funded by the U.S. government and authorized under different statutes. These programs aim to enhance the security capabilities of foreign countries and promote regional stability. Additionally, the report highlights the importance of compliance with international arms control agreements, such as the Arms Trade Treaty and the Wassenaar Arrangement. These agreements help regulate the transfer of defense articles and promote transparency and accountability in arms sales. The text discusses various regulations and processes related to the import and export of defense articles in the United States. The AECA, Section 38, authorizes the President to issue regulations on the import and export of defense articles, which are listed in the United States Munitions List (USML). The President has delegated the authority for administering these regulations to the Secretary of State, who has further delegated it to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Defense Trade Controls. The Department of Defense (DOD) plays a significant role in the sale of defense articles through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, which is administered in coordination with the Department of State. The DOD implements the FMS program as a military-to-military program and offers a sustainment package along with the defense articles. The United States also participates in international agreements such as the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Wassenaar Arrangement, which affect the transfer of defense articles. The FMS process begins with a letter of request (LOR) from the foreign purchaser, which is then followed by a letter of offer and acceptance (LOA) from the United States. The State Department provides regular reports to Congress on the sales and exports of defense articles. The text discusses the process of case executions in Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS). In FMS, the case is implemented once the purchaser signs the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) and provides the necessary documentation and deposit. There are different types of FMS cases, including defined order, blanket order, and cooperative logistics supply support arrangement (CLSSA). Case execution involves various activities such as acquisition, logistics, transportation, maintenance, training, financial management, and documentation. Case managers track the delivery status, and all transactions must be recorded. Customs clearance is the responsibility of the purchaser, and title to the materiel is transferred upon release from the point of origin. In DCS, U.S. firms can sell defense articles directly to foreign partners through licenses obtained from the State Department. The export license application goes through a review process, and compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) is required. DOD does not directly administer DCS sales or facilitate transportation, but it may accommodate a firm's preference for DCS if requested. DCS preferences are valid for one year, and DSCA considers various factors before approving DCS preference for a specific transaction. The SCO chief plays a role in facilitating interactions between U.S. defense industry representatives and host country officials. The text concludes by discussing the various statutes, policies, and regulations that govern the sale and export of U.S. defense articles, including the National Security Presidential Memorandum NSPM-10, which outlines the Trump Administration's policy on arms transfers. The text discusses the process and policies surrounding the transfer of Excess Defense Articles (EDA) from the US Department of Defense (DOD) to foreign countries. EDA refers to defense articles that are no longer needed by the US Armed Forces and are offered to eligible foreign recipients at reduced or no cost. The transfer of EDA is considered on a case-by-case basis and requires justification to Congress. The State Department plays a key role in overseeing security assistance programs and ensuring that arms transfers align with US foreign policy interests. The Bureau of Political-Military Affairs (PM) within the State Department is responsible for policy direction and coordination of arms transfers. The DOD also plays a central role in shaping arms sales policy and implementing transfers. The decision-making process involves various stakeholders, including the President, Congress, and small Security Cooperation Organizations in embassies. The text also mentions the importance of end-use monitoring to ensure compliance with the terms of the transfer and prevent misuse of defense articles. The State Department's Blue Lantern program conducts checks to verify the legitimacy of proposed transactions and compliance with export rules and policies. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency oversees the Golden Sentry program, which is the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) counterpart to the State Department's Blue Lantern program. The objective of Golden Sentry is to ensure compliance with technology control requirements and to ensure that recipients of defense articles and services are following U.S. government requirements regarding their use, transfer, and security. The program includes measures to prevent misuse or unauthorized transfer of these items. The program involves routine End-Use Monitoring (EUM) by the Defense Security Cooperation Organizations (SCOs), who are required to observe and report any potential misuse or unapproved transfer of FMS articles or services. In addition, there is an Enhanced End-Use Monitoring (EEUM) program for security-sensitive defense articles that require specialized physical security and accounting. The EEUM program requires SCOs to conduct annual visits to verify the status of these items. Congress is asked to consider whether current levels of arms sales and exports fulfill statutory and policy objectives, and whether the current methods of conducting sales of defense articles and services are consistent with the intent and objectives of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). The text discusses the resourcing of End Use Monitoring (EUM) programs and the potential disparity between the number of defense articles exported and the number of EUM investigations completed. In FY2018, the State Department's Blue Sentry Program authorized 35,779 export license applications but only initiated 466 Blue Lantern checks. Critics argue that the small staff employed by the State Department cannot adequately track the billions of dollars' worth of defense articles transferred to foreign countries each year. However, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Tina Kaidanow testified that most U.S defense manufacturers are responsible for ensuring compliance with the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) and work closely with the State Department to address any compliance issues. The text also provides examples of legislative restrictions on the sale and export of U.S. defense articles, including restrictions based on human rights violations, countries supporting terrorism, and specific countries and regions. Additionally, there are restrictions on defense articles related to nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.
