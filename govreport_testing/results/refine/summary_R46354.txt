The report provides a timeline of key developments in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, starting with the onset of symptoms among the first known patients. The timeline documents the responses in China, at the World Health Organization (WHO), and in the United States through January 31, 2020. The report includes sections on disease terminology and the Chinese geographic and political context of the outbreak. The disease caused by the novel coronavirus was named "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease was named "coronavirus disease 2019" (COVID-19) by the WHO. China initially referred to the illness as "pneumonia of unknown cause" and later as "viral pneumonia." Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei Province, is the epicenter of the outbreak and is a major transportation hub with direct air routes to destinations around the world. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission oversees hospitals and the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Wuhan CDC). Communist Party secretaries are the most powerful officials in China's political system, and top officials in Hubei Province and Wuhan were replaced during the epidemic. The top officials of the Hubei Provincial Health Commission were also replaced. The report raises issues related to the timeline, but these are not specified in the summary. The report also highlights the challenges faced in accurately determining the timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic. It raises questions about the accuracy and transparency of the information provided by China, particularly in the early stages of the outbreak. The report suggests that China initially downplayed the severity of the illness and delayed sharing crucial information with the international community. This lack of transparency has been a subject of criticism and has hindered efforts to effectively respond to the pandemic. Additionally, the report mentions the replacement of top officials in Hubei Province and Wuhan, indicating a potential failure in leadership and management during the crisis. These developments further contribute to the understanding of the context and challenges surrounding the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.

On January 9, 2020, a team of scientists led by Prof. Yong-Zhen Zhang of Fudan University in Shanghai shares the genomic sequence of the novel coronavirus with the world. This is followed by other Chinese teams sharing sequences as well. The World Health Organization (WHO) receives the genetic sequences from Chinese authorities and expects them to be made publicly available. The annual full session of the People's Congress of Hubei Province opens in Wuhan on January 12, with no new infections reported during the session. Dr. Li Wenliang, who later becomes a whistleblower, is hospitalized with symptoms of the virus. The Shanghai Health Commission orders Prof. Zhang's laboratory to close, but it is unclear if it is related to the publishing of the sequencing data. WHO states that there is no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission and that the outbreak is associated with exposures in a seafood market in Wuhan. Taiwan experts visit Wuhan and are told that limited human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded. The first case of the virus outside of China is confirmed in Thailand. WHO initially reports no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission but later acknowledges the possibility. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission reports no new infections or deaths and states that there is no clear evidence of person-to-person transmission. The People's Congress of Hubei Province concludes, and new infections are reported in Wuhan for the first time since January 3. Chinese leader Xi Jinping visits Burma, and US authorities begin health screenings for travelers from Wuhan. A potluck banquet in Wuhan is later blamed for contributing to the spread of the virus. The National Health Commission high-level expert group arrives in Wuhan, and HHS Secretary Azar briefs President Trump about the epidemic. The first case outside of Hubei Province is confirmed in Guangdong Province. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announces an increase in cases and establishes an epidemic prevention and control command center. The National Health Commission high-level expert group briefs China's cabinet and publicly confirms person-to-person transmission.

People's Daily breaks its silence on the epidemic and reports on it. On January 22, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued its first situation report on the novel coronavirus, reporting 278 confirmed cases in China and four cases outside of the country. The United States confirmed its first case of the virus on January 21, in a patient who had returned from Wuhan. On January 23, the U.S. CDC issued a "Watch Level 2 Alert" for the pneumonia caused by the virus, advising older travelers and those with underlying health issues to discuss travel to Wuhan with their healthcare provider. On the same day, Wuhan Municipality issued an order suspending public transportation and travel in and out of the city. Other cities in Hubei Province also implemented lockdown measures. The provinces of Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Hunan raised their public health emergency response levels to the highest level. The WHO Emergency Committee was unable to reach a consensus on whether the outbreak constituted a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The State Department ordered the mandatory departure of nonemergency U.S. personnel from the U.S. consulate in Wuhan. On January 24, Hubei Province raised its public health emergency response level to the highest level, and an article in The Lancet raised questions about the source of the virus. On January 25, China's Politburo Standing Committee discussed prevention and control of the outbreak and established a high-level working group. By January 26, most of China's provincial-level jurisdictions had raised their public health alerts to the highest level. On January 27, Wuhan's mayor acknowledged the failure to disclose information in a timely manner and the movement of 5 million people out of the city before travel restrictions were implemented. The Chinese government extended the Lunar New Year Holiday to reduce the movement of people. The U.S. offered to send a CDC team to China, but no team was sent at that time. On January 28, China's Supreme People's Court criticized the reprimand of citizens accused of spreading rumors about the disease. President Xi Jinping and WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus met in Beijing and agreed that WHO would send international experts to China. WHO raised its global level risk assessment to "high." On January 29, 2020, the United States organizes a charter flight to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. The flight carries 195 U.S. government personnel and their family members, private U.S. citizens and their family members, and some third country nationals. This makes the United States the first country to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan. The State Department plans to organize four more evacuation flights from Wuhan before the end of February. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo speaks with Yang Jiechi, a member of China's Politburo, expressing condolences for the Chinese citizens who lost their lives and thanking China for their assistance in evacuating Americans. The State Department also authorizes the voluntary departure of nonemergency personnel and their family members from diplomatic posts in mainland China. On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the coronavirus outbreak a "Public Health Emergency of International Concern" (PHEIC), but expresses confidence in China's ability to control the outbreak and does not recommend limiting trade and movement. President Trump announces the formation of the President's Coronavirus Task Force and the State Department elevates its travel advisory for all of China to Level 4 ("do not travel").
