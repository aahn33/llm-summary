The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) on June 5, 2019, which changes the obligations of broker-dealers in their relationships with retail customers. It requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of the customer and address conflicts of interest. The FY2020 Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill included an amendment that would have prevented the SEC from implementing Reg BI, but this amendment was not included in the enacted bill. This report provides background on broker-dealers and investment advisers, discusses the Obama Administration's fiduciary rule for broker-dealers, describes the obligations of Reg BI, examines state-based fiduciary regulations, and presents different perspectives on Reg BI. It also explores the blurred lines between broker-dealers and investment advisers, the Dodd-Frank Act, and the push for a uniform fiduciary standard. Additionally, the report highlights the potential impact of Reg BI on the financial industry and the ongoing debate surrounding the regulation.

The 2016 DOL Fiduciary Rules, adopted by the Obama Administration, changed the definition of investment advice and made broker-dealers fiduciaries when providing recommendations to retirement plan participants. Supporters argued that the rules would prevent financial advisers from directing clients to products that benefited them at the client's expense, while detractors claimed it would increase the cost of retirement accounts and limit access to investment advice. In 2017, President Trump ordered a reexamination of the rule, and in 2018, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the rules. The Trump Administration's DOL has not challenged this decision but is considering new final rules. In June 2019, the SEC approved the Reg BI Final Rule, which requires broker-dealers to act in the best interest of retail investors and address conflicts of interest. Broker-dealers have until June 2020 to comply with the rule. The rule includes a general obligation and three component obligations: duty of disclosure, duty of compliance, and duty of customer care.

The text discusses the conflict of interest obligation under Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI) for broker-dealers. It states that broker-dealers must establish policies and procedures to identify and disclose conflicts of interest, and in some cases, mitigate or eliminate them. Conflicts of interest occur when the interests of the broker-dealer and the customer are misaligned. Federal securities laws and FINRA's rules address conflicts through prohibitions, suitability requirements, and disclosure. The text also mentions state requirements and initiatives to impose fiduciary duties on broker-dealers. It highlights concerns about potential loopholes and a patchwork of laws. The text further discusses a lawsuit filed by Attorneys General to vacate Reg BI, citing failure to restrict conflicted advice and increased investor confusion. Congressional concerns and actions are also mentioned, including a letter criticizing Reg BI and a bill to restrict SEC's authority. The text concludes by presenting various perspectives on Reg BI, including qualified support, broad support, and criticism from different stakeholders.

The text now discusses different perspectives on the fiduciary duty and conflicts of interest in the context of the SEC's Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI). Some SEC commissioners argue that the fiduciary duty is misunderstood and that applying it to broker-dealers would limit investor access and increase costs. However, others argue that a fiduciary standard would not negatively affect investment advice availability and that it would lead to stronger growth for broker-dealers. The text also addresses the issue of conflicts of interest, with some arguing that Reg BI does not adequately address these conflicts and others stating that the rule requires firms to mitigate and eliminate conflicts in the best interest of customers. Overall, there are differing opinions on the effectiveness of Reg BI in addressing fiduciary duty and conflicts of interest.

The SEC's 700-page release on Reg BI reform acknowledges its inability to use data-based research to determine the economic effects of the reform. However, the release discusses the theoretical costs and benefits of an alternative fiduciary standard for broker-dealers. It suggests that a uniform fiduciary standard could reduce customer confusion and costs associated with choosing a financial professional. However, it also argues that this standard may not be appropriate for the broker-dealer model and could result in a decrease in options in the financial advice market. The release also examines the potential consequences of brokers transitioning into offering advice as investment advisers, limiting retail customers' access to certain securities and increasing costs for advice. The text also highlights various studies that have examined the impact of a fiduciary standard on brokers, with differing views on the nature of this impact. These studies include the Deloitte-SIFMA Study, which found that the DOL fiduciary rule led to a trend towards fee-based accounts, and research by Finke and Langdon, which found no significant differences in brokers' behavior in states with stricter fiduciary standards. Another study by Bhattacharya, Padi, and Illanes found that subjecting brokers to a fiduciary duty improved the quality of financial advice but also increased costs for brokers.
