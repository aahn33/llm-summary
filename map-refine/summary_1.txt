As Nick settles into his new home, he becomes intrigued by the lavish lifestyle of his neighbor, Jay Gatsby. Gatsby is known for throwing extravagant parties, but no one seems to know much about him. Nick attends one of Gatsby's parties and is both amazed and bewildered by the opulence and excess. He observes the guests, who are a mix of socialites, celebrities, and even some shady characters. Despite the grandeur of the event, Nick feels a sense of emptiness and superficiality among the attendees.

Amidst the chaos of the party, Nick encounters Jordan Baker, a professional golfer and friend of Daisy. They strike up a conversation, and Jordan reveals that Daisy and Gatsby were once in love. However, Daisy ultimately chose to marry Tom Buchanan, a wealthy and powerful man. This revelation piques Nick's curiosity about Gatsby and his connection to Daisy.

As the summer progresses, Nick becomes more entangled in the lives of those around him. He attends a luncheon at Daisy and Tom's mansion, where he witnesses the strained dynamics of their marriage. Tom is openly having an affair, and Daisy seems resigned to her unhappy situation. Nick also learns that Tom is involved in shady business dealings, further adding to the intrigue and mystery surrounding the characters in this affluent society.

In this passage from F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," Daisy shares with Nick her feelings about her newborn daughter, expressing a desire for her to be a "beautiful little fool" in a world that she believes is terrible. However, Nick senses the insincerity in Daisy's words and feels that she is putting on a show for him. Later, Nick visits Tom and Daisy's house and meets Jordan Baker, a friend of Daisy's. Daisy and Tom discuss Jordan and Daisy suggests that Nick and Jordan spend time together. As Nick leaves, Daisy questions him about rumors of his engagement, which he denies. He drives home and sees a figure, possibly Gatsby, standing by the water. The passage then shifts to a description of the "valley of ashes," a desolate area near the train tracks where Tom's mistress, Myrtle, lives. Tom takes Nick to meet Myrtle at a garage owned by her husband, George Wilson. Myrtle appears and Tom arranges to meet her later.

Tom Buchanan and his mistress, Myrtle Wilson, go to New York City together. Myrtle lies to her husband, George, telling him she is visiting her sister. In New York, Myrtle changes into a new dress and buys some items at a drugstore. She then expresses a desire to buy a dog, and they stop to look at puppies being sold by a man on the street. Tom corrects Myrtle when she mistakes one of the puppies for a police dog. They eventually arrive at Myrtle's small apartment, where they are joined by Myrtle's sister, Catherine, and her husband, Mr. McKee. The group drinks and socializes, with Myrtle and Catherine discussing their dissatisfaction with their marriages. Myrtle reveals that she and Tom plan to get married and move out West. Catherine also lies about her recent trip to Europe.

In this passage, the narrator is momentarily distracted by the beautiful sky outside before being interrupted by Mrs. McKee. Mrs. McKee shares a personal story about almost marrying someone she considered beneath her, referring to him as a "little kike." She explains that despite others warning her about his social status, she believes that if she hadn't met her current husband, Chester, she would have ended up with the other man. This anecdote highlights Mrs. McKee's shallow and judgmental nature, as well as the societal prejudices and class distinctions present in the story.

Through his interactions with Daisy, Tom, and Gatsby, Nick begins to question the values and morals of the wealthy elite. He sees the emptiness and corruption that lies beneath their glamorous fa√ßade. As the story unfolds, Nick finds himself caught in a web of deceit, love, and tragedy, ultimately leading to a shocking conclusion.

The text begins with a conversation between Myrtle Wilson and Catherine, where Myrtle reveals that she married her husband because she thought he was a gentleman, but quickly realized he was not. Myrtle also denies being crazy about her husband and points out that she was only crazy when she married him. The conversation takes place at a party where everyone is drinking and arguing. Later, Myrtle tells the story of how she first met Tom Buchanan and became involved with him. The text then transitions to a description of Gatsby's extravagant parties, where people come and go without being formally invited. The narrator, who has been invited to one of Gatsby's parties, arrives and tries to find his host but is unsuccessful. He then meets Jordan Baker and they join a group of people at a table.

The text describes a party at Gatsby's mansion, where the guests engage in gossip and speculation about Gatsby's past. Lucille shares a story about receiving a gift from Gatsby after tearing her gown at a previous party. The conversation turns to rumors about Gatsby, with some suggesting he may have killed a man or been a German spy during the war. The narrator and Jordan Baker leave the party to find Gatsby, and they stumble upon a drunk man in the library who turns out to be Gatsby himself. Gatsby invites the narrator to go boating with him the next day. The narrator is surprised to learn that Gatsby is the host of the party, as he had expected someone different. Jordan and the narrator discuss Gatsby's background, with Jordan expressing doubt about his claims of attending Oxford. The party continues with music and dancing, and Gatsby stands apart from the crowd. The butler interrupts to inform Jordan that Gatsby wants to speak to her alone, and she leaves with him. The narrator is left alone and decides to explore the mansion.

The party is filled with drama and tension, with one of the girls playing the piano and singing while drunk and crying. Couples at the party are fighting, and there is a general reluctance to go home. The narrator, who has been observing the events, leaves the party and witnesses a car accident outside. The driver, who is drunk, claims that he wasn't driving and that there was another man in the car. Reflecting on his own life, work, and relationship with Jordan Baker, the narrator realizes that he needs to end a relationship back home before pursuing anything with Jordan.

Gatsby hints at having a big request for the narrator, which will be discussed later in the afternoon. The car ride continues through the city, passing by various landmarks, and ends with Gatsby using his connections to avoid a traffic violation. The chapter concludes with a description of the city seen from the Queensboro Bridge.

As they cross Blackwell's Island, the narrator and Gatsby witness a funeral procession. A dead man is being transported in a hearse, followed by carriages with drawn blinds. The friends of the deceased have a somber appearance, typical of southeastern Europe. The narrator finds it interesting that Gatsby's luxurious car is included in the procession. Continuing their journey, they see a limousine driven by a white chauffeur, carrying three stylish African Americans. The narrator finds this amusing and thinks that anything can happen now that they have crossed the bridge.

The narrator meets Gatsby for lunch in a cellar on Forty-second Street. They are joined by Mr. Wolfshiem, who tells a story about a man named Rosy Rosenthal being shot outside the old Metropole. Gatsby and Mr. Wolfshiem discuss going for highballs, but Gatsby decides against it. They then discuss Gatsby's mysterious business dealings, and Mr. Wolfshiem mistakenly believes the narrator is the person Gatsby is looking for. Gatsby abruptly leaves, and the narrator is left alone with Mr. Wolfshiem. The narrator then recounts a story told by Jordan Baker about Daisy Fay, who was engaged to a soldier but was prevented from saying goodbye to him. Daisy later married Tom Buchanan of Chicago in a lavish wedding. The narrator was a bridesmaid at the wedding and found Daisy drunk and upset. Daisy gave back a string of pearls and said she had changed her mind. Jordan Baker tells the narrator about Daisy's reaction to receiving a letter from Gatsby.

They later have a daughter and go to France for a year before returning to Chicago. Daisy is popular in Chicago and has a perfect reputation. Six weeks ago, Daisy heard the name Gatsby for the first time in years and became interested in him. The narrator then invites Daisy to his house for tea and Gatsby asks if he can come over as well. The narrator agrees and Gatsby's house is lit up when he arrives home. Gatsby suggests going to Coney Island, but the narrator declines. The next day, the narrator calls Daisy and invites her to tea. On the day of the tea, it is raining and Gatsby arrives in a hurry. However, nobody else shows up for the tea and Gatsby decides to leave. Daisy arrives in a large open car and is ecstatic to see Nick. Gatsby, who is also present, appears pale and distraught. They all go inside, where Gatsby and Daisy have an awkward reunion. Gatsby tries to act nonchalant but is clearly nervous. They all sit down and have tea, during which Gatsby becomes more at ease and Daisy begins to cry when she sees Gatsby's collection of beautiful shirts. The narrator and Gatsby then go outside and Gatsby mentions the green light at the end of Daisy's dock, which used to hold great significance for him but now seems less important. They go inside and Gatsby shows Daisy clippings about her. They are interrupted by a phone call, and then Daisy notices the pink and golden clouds outside. They decide to have Klipspringer play the piano, and the narrator leaves them alone. The next section reveals more about Gatsby's past. A reporter arrives at Gatsby's house, asking for a statement, but Gatsby doesn't have anything to say. The reporter's visit highlights Gatsby's growing notoriety and the rumors surrounding him. The narrator then recounts Gatsby's past, including his name change and his time working for Dan Cody. Cody's death led to Gatsby inheriting money, but it was taken away from him through a legal device. The narrator clarifies that these rumors about Gatsby's past are not true. The passage ends with the narrator visiting Gatsby's house and encountering Tom Buchanan.

Gatsby expresses his delight at the arrival of the person he is speaking to. However, it is implied that Gatsby is not genuinely pleased to see them, as he sarcastically remarks that they "cared" about his presence. Gatsby then invites the person to sit down and offers them a cigarette or cigar. He proceeds to move around the room, ringing bells, and promises to have a drink ready for them shortly.

In this passage from F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," tensions rise as Tom confronts Gatsby about his relationship with Daisy. Tom is angry and accuses Gatsby of being a "common swindler." Gatsby insists that Daisy never loved Tom and that she only married him because Gatsby was poor at the time. Daisy hesitates but eventually admits that she did love Gatsby once, but she also loved Tom. Gatsby becomes distraught and insists that Daisy is leaving Tom for him. Tom dismisses this claim and threatens to investigate Gatsby's illegal activities. The mention of Walter Chase suggests that Gatsby may have been involved in some kind of business deal or venture. Gatsby's response implies that Walter Chase was not hesitant to participate in it, indicating that it may have been a lucrative opportunity. This conversation hints at Gatsby's connections and involvement in various ventures, further adding to the mystery surrounding his wealth and background. The passage ends with Daisy pleading to leave the situation. They all discuss the idea of taking cold baths and having mint juleps.

In this passage, Michaelis reflects on the events leading up to George Wilson's death. He recalls how Mrs. Wilson had been running away from her husband and how Wilson had confronted her, believing that she couldn't fool God. Wilson then sees the eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg, a billboard advertisement, and repeats that God sees everything. Michaelis leaves Wilson and later finds out that Wilson had been searching for a yellow car, which leads him to Gatsby's house.

However, he is not completely surprised by Gatsby's death, as he has reached an age where death is no longer shocking. As Mr. Gatz looks around the grandeur of the mansion, he feels a mix of grief and pride. The narrator helps Mr. Gatz to a bedroom and informs him that all arrangements for Gatsby's funeral have been postponed until his arrival. Mr. Gatz corrects the narrator, stating that his name is Gatz, not Gatsby.

The funeral of Jay Gatsby takes place in the rain with only a few attendees, including the owl-eyed man from Gatsby's library. Mr. Gatz, Gatsby's father, is hesitant to take Gatsby's body West for burial, as Gatsby had always preferred the East.
