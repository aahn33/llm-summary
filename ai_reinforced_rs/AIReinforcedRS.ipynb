            "(content=\"The fiend argues with Victor, claiming that he is malicious because he is miserable. He questions why he should pity mankind when they shun and hate him. The fiend expresses his desire for a companion of the opposite sex who is as hideous as himself, believing that they would be more attached to each other. He promises to live peacefully and harmlessly in the wilds of South America. Victor is moved by the fiend's plea but ultimately refuses, fearing the consequences of his consent. He warns the fiend that he may return seeking the kindness of mankind, only to be met with detestation and continue his destructive path.\" id=70),(content=\"The narrator has been told by M. Krempe that his previous studies in natural philosophy were a waste of time and that he must start over. M. Krempe gives the narrator a list of books to study and mentions that lectures on natural philosophy will begin the following week. The narrator is not disappointed by this news as he already considered the authors he had been studying useless. The narrator describes M. Krempe as unappealing and does not have a favorable opinion of his pursuits. The narrator reflects on his own early interest in science and how it differed from the modern approach. The narrator then mentions M. Waldman, another professor who will be lecturing on chemistry. The narrator decides to attend one of M. Waldman's lectures out of curiosity and idleness. M. Waldman is described as benevolent and gives a lecture on the history and improvements of chemistry. The narrator is impressed by M. Waldman's lecture and is particularly moved by his praise of modern chemistry.\" id=16),(content=\"In this passage, the creature recounts how he left the scene of the murder and entered a barn where he found a young woman sleeping. He contemplates waking her up and confessing his love for her, but fears that she will see him as a murderer and denounce him. Instead, he decides to frame her for the murder by placing the portrait of his beloved in her dress. He then confesses to Victor that he has been wandering the mountains, consumed by a burning passion that only Victor can fulfill. He demands that Victor create a female companion for him, someone who is as deformed and miserable as he is.
